# ML_Assingment
In the Academic Year ,College gave  Assignment of  Handwritten Letter Classification Challenge  and I did Completed the Assignment. and I felt that share this Assignment on GitHub. ***In Assingment College gave Six(6) Question:*** 

Train a machine learning model to classify any 10 letters. The project involves the following steps;

1. Collect images of handwritten letters .
2. Split the data into train and test tests (80% train and 20% test)
3. Use dimension reduction techniques, PCA and t-SNE to reduce the dimensions of the data
4. Train a classification model using neural networks and support vector machines on the training data
5. Validate the model on the test data 
6. Find tune the parameters to increase the classification accuracies of the model on training and test data.


In This Assignment  I have collected A to Z handwritten letters CSV data file . and import  in to  jupyter notebook. for that I Imported  required  libraries such as  "matplotlib","cv2","numpy" ,"pandas",
"from keras.models import Sequential",
"from keras.layers import Dense, Flatten, Conv2D, MaxPool2D, Dropout",
"from tensorflow.keras.optimizers import SGD".
"from tensorflow.keras.optimizers import Adam",
"from keras.optimizers import SGD, Adam",
"from keras.callbacks import ReduceLROnPlateau, EarlyStopping",
"from tensorflow.keras.utils import to_categorical",
"from keras.utils import to_categorical",
"from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split"
"from sklearn.utils import shuffle" this all libraries. please go through the file and check.

in this Hand Written Letter detectction  module i got ***97% accuracy.***
